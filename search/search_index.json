The objects, such as builds, pull requests, issues, and tests, come from tools that you integrate into the value stream. Individual objects are represented graphically by small circles called dots. Dots frequently provide information from logically related tools, such as issues linked to source control commits.</p> <p>When you create a value stream, a minimal value stream is configured and displayed on the Value stream view. The highest level of a value stream is a phase. Phases represent important, organizational parts of the value stream, such as \"Planning,\" or \"Development.\" On the Value stream view, processing is done in left-right order. For example, your first phase might be for planning and contain items created in an issue tracking system. Your next phase, used for development, can track source control activity related to the issues, and any builds triggered by the activity. Your final phase, used for deployment, might track the related build artifacts as they move through your testing environments toward production.</p> <p>Phases contain stages that define process flow within a phase. A development phase that integrates a source control tool might contain an In Progress stage followed by In Review and Merged stages. When you customize a value stream, you define the phases and stages and their order.</p> <p>Stages are containers for dots. Dots represent units of work from HCL Accelerate or tools that are integrated into the value stream. Git commits or Jira issues, to take just two, are represented by individual dots. Work items, such as commits and builds, can be combined into individual dots. A dot's position in the value stream conveys important information about the object. Dots in a stage named Merged might represent items merged into Git repositories. An item's shape and color convey information about the item's type and status. A dot outlined in red, for example, might mean the item is past schedule. When dots change state, they move to new stages in near-real time.</p> <p>Finally, when you click on a dot, the displayed card provides information about the work items, including their history, and provides links to associated tools.</p>"},{"location":"measure/#have-a-look-at-the-value-stream","title":"Have a look at the Value Stream","text":"<p>Please click on \"Emerald ...\" Link to open the value stream and explore the shown data.
